In this repository, we see yaml files as configuration files for kubernetes. Further, we'll feed these two config files to kubectl. And then, Kubectl will create objects( a thing that exists inside kubernetes cluster)

## A few types of Objects are:

- **StatefulSet**
- **ReplicaController**
- **Pod**
- **Server**
